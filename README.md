# Cerberus
*A Local-First Parental Monitoring System*

> **Protect what matters most — without sacrificing privacy.**  
> Cerberus continuously monitors a child’s screen for inappropriate content, saves full screenshots and cropped detections, and alerts parents in real time.  
> Everything runs **locally**, ensuring data never leaves your home network.

## Core Features
- **Continuous Screen Monitoring** – Detects NSFW or inappropriate images in real time.  
- **AI-Powered Detection** – Uses locally hosted models (PyTorch-based).  
- **Instant Alerts** – Sends notifications via **Discord Webhooks** (eventually be replaced with dedicated app).  
- **Local-Only Web Portal** – View events securely on your LAN (no cloud dependencies).  
- **Adjustable Sensitivity** – Tune model thresholds for stricter or more lenient detection.  
- **Client Connection Watchdog** – Detects if the monitored PC goes offline or disables monitoring.

## 🧠 System Architecture

### **Server**
- Hosts the NSFW detection models.  
- Stores screenshots, cropped detections, and event logs.  
- Sends notifications and serves the local web portal.  
- Can be run **headless** after initial setup.

### **Client**
- Installed on the monitored PC.  
- Captures screen images and securely transmits them to the local server.  

All communications are local and encrypted — nothing ever leaves your private network.
